## ✨ Core Features

* **🎭 Immersive Live2D Interaction**: Real-time Live2D rendering and voice conversation in the browser.
* **🧠 Decision-Roleplay-Agent Three-Layer Architecture**: Fully decouples role-play from tool execution for fast responses without breaking character.
* **🛠️ Serious Productivity**: Local file read/write, scheduled and periodic tasks, Skills, and long-term memory — actually gets things done.
* **🌐 Multi-Platform Support**: Ready-to-use WebUI with seamless integration for QQ and Telegram.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

Typical AI Agents are slow and token-heavy by nature due to large tool lists and skill systems. Mixing character settings with task instructions leads to "character dilution" and degrades execution efficiency.

EchoBot uses a **Decision - Roleplay - Agent** three-layer architecture to solve this:

### 1. 🧠 Decision Layer

Accurately and quickly identifies user intent.

* **Hybrid Intent Recognition**: Dual-engine using `Rules + Lightweight LLM`. Clear commands bypass the large model and trigger background tasks directly; ambiguous intent is classified by a lightweight LLM.
* **Smart Dispatch**: Casual chat is routed to the **Roleplay Layer**; complex tasks silently wake the **Agent Core** while the Roleplay Layer notifies the user that the task has started.

### 2. 🎭 Roleplay Layer

Focused purely on emotional value and immersion (๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵) ♡.

* **Clean Context**: Strips away tool-use metadata, optimized for text/voice generation — ensuring vivid tone, instant replies, and no out-of-character moments.
* **Context Awareness**: Intelligently switches dialogue based on system state (e.g., idle chat, task started, task completed).

### 3. ⚙️ Agent Core

Runs silently in the background to complete assigned tasks.

* **Full Agent Capabilities**: Integrated tool chains (Tools), skill libraries (Skills), and long/short-term memory (Memory).
* **System-Level Access**: Can read/write local files and interact with the operating system.
* **Async Collaboration**: Automatically summarizes results when done and has your anime companion personally deliver the report to you.

## 🎨 Customization

### 👗 Import / Switch Live2D Models

A complete Live2D asset is typically a folder containing `.model3.json` and related files. The project ships with 2 built-in Live2D assets. You can upload or switch models directly from the web control panel:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/webui_live2d.png" width="50%">
</p>

After uploading, the companion automatically copies the folder to `.echobot/live2d`. You can also manually copy a Live2D asset folder there — it will be loaded on next startup.

Eye-tracking (mouse follow) is enabled by default and can be toggled in the panel.

### 🖼️ Import / Switch Backgrounds

Upload your favorite background images via the web control panel:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/webui_background.png" width="50%">
</p>

### 🖼️ Image Upload & Download

For vision-capable models (e.g., `qwen3.5-plus` and `kimi-k2.5`), you can send images directly to your companion, and your companion can send images back to you as well.

> 💡 **Tip**: If your model does not support image input, set `ECHOBOT_LLM_SUPPORTS_IMAGE_INPUT=false` in the project's `.env` file to reduce accidental image-related actions by the assistant.

### 📁 File Upload & Download

Beyond images, your companion can also help you handle various types of files:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/webui_file.png" width="100%">
</p>

### ⏰ Scheduled & Periodic Tasks

Your companion can remember important things and execute them on time:

* **Cron Tasks**: Triggered at a specific time. Simply tell your companion "remind me to attend the meeting in 30 minutes" and a task will be created automatically.
  * Task data is stored in `.echobot/cron/jobs.json`.
* **Heartbeat Tasks**: Triggered at a fixed interval, defaulting to every 30 minutes.
  * Adjust the interval via `ECHOBOT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` in `.env` (in seconds).
  * Edit the heartbeat task file from the web panel or directly at `.echobot/HEARTBEAT.md`.

  <img src="./assets/webui_heartbeat.png" height="300" alt="Heartbeat Jobs">
</p>

### 🚦 Router Mode

Switch the working mode manually in the web UI based on your needs:

🤖 **Auto (Default)**: Intelligently identifies intent and decides whether to invoke the background Agent (≧◡≦) ♡.

💬 **Chat Only**: Fully disables background tasks to prevent accidental triggers — perfect for companionship (⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄).

🛠️ **Force Agent**: Become a relentless productivity machine — skips intent recognition and forces all messages through the background task pipeline (ง๑ •̀_•́)ง.

### 🎙️ Voice Features (TTS & ASR)

EchoBot's web UI supports half-duplex voice interaction. Switch voice backends flexibly from the control panel:

**🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS):**

Two free backends are supported:

* [edge-tts](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts): Online synthesis, free with no API key required.
* [kokoro-multi-lang-v1_1](https://k2-fsa.github.io/sherpa/onnx/tts/all/Chinese-English/kokoro-multi-lang-v1_1.html): Local offline synthesis; model weights are downloaded automatically on first launch.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/webui_tts.png" width="75%">
</p>

**🎙️ Speech Recognition (ASR):**

Powered by the [SenseVoice](https://k2-fsa.github.io/sherpa/onnx/sense-voice/index.html) model via sherpa-onnx — fully local and offline; model weights are downloaded automatically on first launch.

EchoBot's web UI supports half-duplex voice interaction (microphone is muted during playback to prevent echo). Both "Push to Talk" and "Always-On Mic" modes are supported.

### 🔌 Advanced: Custom Voice Models

EchoBot supports TTS and ASR interfaces that follow the **OpenAI-compatible API**, so you can replace the built-in voice models with your own local or cloud services:

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/webui_custom_1.png" width="50%" alt="Custom Voice Model Settings">
</p>

**🗣️ Custom TTS:**

Supports services compatible with the `OpenAI Speech API`.

For example, you can use [vLLM Omni Speech](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/vllm-omni/en/latest/serving/speech_api/) to deploy speech synthesis models such as `Qwen3-TTS` or `Fish Speech S2 Pro` locally. After starting the vLLM service, configure the endpoint URL and model name in `.env`:

```text
ECHOBOT_TTS_OPENAI_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice
ECHOBOT_TTS_OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8091/v1
```

**🎙️ Custom ASR:**

Supports services compatible with the `OpenAI Transcriptions API`.

For example, follow the [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.com.cn/projects/recipes/en/latest/Qwen/Qwen3-ASR.html) to deploy `Qwen3-ASR`. After starting the vLLM service, configure the endpoint URL and model name in `.env`:

```text
ECHOBOT_ASR_OPENAI_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B
ECHOBOT_ASR_OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
```

## 💻 Terminal & Chat Platform Commands

When running in the terminal or interacting via a chat platform, the following built-in commands are available for session management and persona switching~

### 📁 Session Management

| Command | Usage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/new` | `/new [title]` | Create a new session (optional title) |
| `/ls` | `/ls` | List all sessions |
| `/switch` | `/switch <number>` | Switch to the specified session |
| `/rename` | `/rename <title>` | Rename the current session |
| `/delete` | `/delete` | Delete the current session |
| `/current` | `/current` | View current session info |
| `/help` | `/help` | Show global command help |

### 🎭 Role Management

| Command | Usage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/role` | `/role` | View current character card |
| `/role list` | `/role list` | List all character cards |
| `/role current` | `/role current` | View current character card details |
| `/role set` | `/role set <name>` | Switch to a specified character card |
| `/role help` | `/role help` | Show role command help |

### 🧭 Route Mode

These route mode commands use the same session routing setting as the route mode switch in the web UI~

| Command | Usage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/route` | `/route` | Show the current route mode for this session |
| `/route current` | `/route current` | Show the current route mode for this session |
| `/route auto` | `/route auto` | Switch to automatic routing |
| `/route chat` | `/route chat` | Switch to chat-only mode |
| `/route agent` | `/route agent` | Switch to force-agent mode |
| `/route set` | `/route set <auto\|chat_only\|force_agent>` | Set the route mode explicitly |
| `/route help` | `/route help` | Show route mode command help |

### ⚙️ Runtime Configuration

| Command | Usage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/runtime` | `/runtime` | List runtime settings and current values |
| `/runtime list` | `/runtime list` | List runtime settings and current values |
| `/runtime get` | `/runtime get <name>` | Show one runtime setting |
| `/runtime set` | `/runtime set <name> <value>` | Update one runtime setting |
| `/runtime help` | `/runtime help` | Show runtime command help |

Example: use `delegated_ack_enabled` to control whether EchoBot sends a quick notice before a background task starts.

```text
/runtime get delegated_ack_enabled
/runtime set delegated_ack_enabled on
/runtime set delegated_ack_enabled off
```

- When set to `on`: EchoBot sends a short "started working" style message first, then sends the final result when the task finishes.
- When set to `off`: the background task runs silently until the final result is ready.
